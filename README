NAME
    DateTime::Format::PayPal::IPN - Parse PayPal IPN timestamps

VERSION
    version 0.000001

SYNOPSIS
        use DateTime::Format::PayPal::IPN;

        my $dt = DateTime::Format::PayPal::IPN->parse_timestamp( '02:35:35 Feb 16, 2010 PST' );

        # 2010-02-16 02:35:35
        DateTime::Format::PayPal::IPN->format_timestamp($dt);

DESCRIPTION
    This module parses and formats timestamps returned by PayPal's IPN
    (Instant Payment Notification) system.

METHODS
    *   parse_timestamp($string)

        Given a value of the appropriate type, this method will return a new
        DateTime object. The time zone for this object will always be the
        'America/Los_Angeles' as all IPN data which I have seen is sent in
        this time zone format.

        If given an improperly formatted string, this method should die.

    *   format_timestamp($datetime)

        Given a "DateTime" object, this methods returns an appropriately
        formatted string.

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
    Most of the Pod was directly lifted from Dave Rolsky's
    DateTime::Format::MySQL.
